    <p>
      He has worked with his muscles, his brain and his pen,
    </p>
    <p>
      For ages, to ransom the children of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reformer in politics, morals, and law,
    </p>
    <p>
      The noblest example the world ever saw.
    </p>
    <p>
      The true type of progress for each generation,
    </p>
    <p>
      He works out his problems in every nation.
    </p>
    <p>
      For every man he does what he can,
    </p>
    <p>
      And never diverges one jot from his plan;
    </p>
    <p>
      He lays his foundation in human equality,
    </p>
    <p>
      And this, he affirms, is the only right polity.
    </p>
    <p>
      To old Plymouth Rock, with the Pilgrims he came,
    </p>
    <p>
      And the wilderness echoed the notes of his fame;
    </p>
    <p>
      And he worked with a will, till the top-stone was laid,
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Temple of Freedom, the house he had made.

      And so deep, and so wide did he lay the foundation,
    </p>
    <p>
      That it took half the continent for its location.

      What Cow, beside her, cropped the rich, flowery mead,

    </p>
    <p>
      Now it happened, one day, that the ill-favored hound

      Was worrying pussy, who refuge had found

    <p>
      The ruin of each beast in the National Lot.

    <p>
      But the Dog was transformed! and a demon was there,
    </p>
    <p>
      Incarnate and hidden, beneath the whelp's hair;
    </p>
    <p>
      Divinity issued its fiat of Fate,
    </p>
    <p>
      And the dog-fiend stood ready to launch forth its hate.

    <p>
      With demoniac rage, and a terrible roar,
    </p>
    <p>
      That none but a fiend ever uttered before,
    </p>
    <p>
      He sprung to his work of destruction and death,

      Intending to finish it up with a breath!

      Put her horns to his ribs, and then&mdash;sent him up-flying!

      For the Holy of Holies, the Patriot's shrine.

      Now draw the rich nourishment freely, sweet maid!

    <p>
      Immense as the cost is, do not be afraid;
    </p>
    <p>
      The stream inexhaustible, now, at thy will,
    </p>
    <p>
      Shall flow like a river, the Temple to fill,
    </p>
    <p>
      And the world shall acknowledge that Freemen can keep,

    <p>
      With dignified firmness, the harvest they reap!

    <p>
      No queen, though her form should be peerless in grace&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Though the smile of a seraph illumined her face&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Could compare with sweet Liberty, matchless, divine,
    </p>
    <p>
      As she stood in her loveliness there at the shrine;
    </p>
    <p>
      And angels smiled down from their home in the skies,

    <p>
      And the bowed ones of earth wiped the tears from their eyes,

      And the spirits of patriots rejoiced to behold

    <p>
      In season and out, at all times of the year,
    </p>
    <p>
      If his presence was needed he'd surely be there.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would weep with the mourner, rejoice with the gay,
    </p>
    <p>
      And help, with a blessing, the poor on their way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Untiring, incessant, he grudged every minute
    </p>
    <p>
      That kept him from work&mdash;for his heart, it was in it!
    </p>
    <p>
      The lark was too late with its carol so sweet,
    </p>
    <p>
      As it soared in the morning the sunshine to greet;
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest could not slumber so long on his bed,
    </p>
    <p>
      For he knew that his Master had not, for his head,
    </p>
    <p>
      A pillow to rest on; and <i>he</i> would not dare

    <p>
      To refuse, in degree, his privations to share.
    </p>
    <p>
      But listen! The cock, with a shrill chanticleer,
    </p>
    <p>
      Proclaims, by his voice, that the dawning is near.
    </p>
    <p>
      Awake, Priest, awake! To thy labors once more!
    </p>
    <p>
      Away to the Temple, God's grace to implore
    </p>
    <p>
      On the day&mdash;on the nuptials&mdash;and on this great nation,

      Haste, haste to the altar&mdash;thy vesture gird on!

    <p>
      A nation of freemen to-day are new-born,

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
